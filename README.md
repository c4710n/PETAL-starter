# PETAL starter

> An alternative `assets` dir for PETAL stack.

## What is PETAL?

PETAL is a stack for building a web application with a responsive and reactive user experience.

- [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/)
- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine)
- [LiveView](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view)

> [Google it for more](https://www.google.com/search?q=petal+stack).

## How it works?

This project **generates** [a solid foundation](https://github.com/c4710n/phx-webpack-example/tree/master/apps/hello_web/assets) for working with TailwindCSS and Alpine.js.

> It works by generating code into the user's application instead of using a library, the user has complete freedom to modify the code so it works best with their app.
> -- the same idea from [phx_gen_auth](https://github.com/aaronrenner/phx_gen_auth)

## Preface

Initial commit of this project is generated by following command:

```sh
$ mix phx.new phx-webpack-example --app hello --umbrella --live --no-ecto
```

And I recommend you to create your project with:

```sh
$ mix phx.new demo --umbrella --live
```

## Usage

### For umbrella projects

1. Replace your `apps/<app>_web/assets` with `apps/hello_web/assets`:

```sh
$ rm -rf <app>_web/assets
$ svn export \
  https://github.com/c4710n/phx-webpack-example/trunk/apps/hello_web/assets \
  apps/<app>_web/assets
```

> SVN provides `export` function which is useful for copying a sub-directory from a repo.

2. Adjust `config/dev.exs` to setup `watchers`:

```ex
config :hello, HelloWeb.Endpoint,
  # ...
  watchers: [
    npm: [
      "run",
      "watch",
      cd: # ...
    ]
  ]
```

### For non-umbrella projects

1. Replace your `assets` with `apps/hello_web/assets`:

```sh
$ rm -rf assets
$ svn export \
  https://github.com/c4710n/phx-webpack-example/trunk/apps/hello_web/assets \
  assets
```

2. Adjust `assets/package.json` in order to fix the path:

```json
// ...

"dependencies": {
  "phoenix": "file:../deps/phoenix",
  "phoenix_html": "file:../deps/phoenix_html",
  "phoenix_live_view": "file:../deps/phoenix_live_view",

// ...
```

3. Adjust `config/dev.exs` to setup `watchers`:

```ex
config :hello, HelloWeb.Endpoint,
  # ...
  watchers: [
    npm: [
      "run",
      "watch",
      cd: # ...
    ]
  ]
```
